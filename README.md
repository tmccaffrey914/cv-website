## How to Set Up Development Environment:
```
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd <REPO_NAME>
npm install
npm run watch
```

This will build the project - so in your browser, open the file at `<REPO_NAME>/index.html`.
The "watch" command instructs WebPack to rebuild the project any time a code change is made,
which should automatically trigger a refresh in your browser.
